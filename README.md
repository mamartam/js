# Java Script (practice)
This repository is created to practice and learn JavaScript through small mini-projects.
Each mini-project is stored in a `separate branch` and represents a simple web-page where I practice different `JavaScript` concepts and topics.

The main branch contains a README with an overview of all completed projects, including:

- a description of each project,
- the JavaScript topics and skills I practiced,
- video previews to demonstrate how each web page works.

To explore the source code of a specific project, you can switch to the corresponding branch.
This structure helps me keep my learning process organized and clearly track my progress in JavaScript development.
